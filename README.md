# bydata

This file contains the core functionality for interacting with a JSON database file (`db.json`). It provides the following functions:

- `readData()`: Reads the contents of the `db.json` file and returns the parsed JSON data as an array of objects. If the file cannot be read, it returns an empty array.
- `writeData(data)`: Writes the provided `data` array to the `db.json` file as a JSON string.
- `editData(id, updatedData)`: Finds an object in the database with the given `id` and updates its properties with the `updatedData` object.
- `addData(newData)`: Adds a new `newData` object to the end of the database array.
- `setup(jsonFilePath)`: Initializes the `db.json` file with the contents of the provided `jsonFilePath`.

- ## Read `usage.md` for details.

The file uses the built-in `fs` (file system) and `path` modules to handle file operations and path resolution, respectively.
